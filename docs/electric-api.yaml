        - name: root_table
          in: path
          schema:
            type: string
          required: true
          description: The shape definition, currently the name of the table.
        # Query parameters
        - name: where
          in: query
          schema:
            type: string
          description: Optional where clause to filter rows belonging to the shape.
        - name: shape_id
          in: query
          schema:
            type: string
          description: The shape ID returned by the initial shape request.
            This is a required parameter when this is not an initial sync request, i.e. when offset > -1.
            The sync engine does not use it but it's used as a cache buster.
        - name: offset
          in: query
          schema:
            type: integer
            minimum: -1
          description: The offset in the shape stream where to resume from.
            Specify -1 for initial sync (or just leave it out).
            Afterwards, need to specify the offset from where to continue in the stream.
        - name: live
          in: query
          schema:
            type: boolean
          description: Whether to subscribe to live updates of the shape.
