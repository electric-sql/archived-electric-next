# A new approach to building Electric

S:

- last few weeks we've jumped into an experimental new approach to engineering the Electric sync layer
- informed by
  - challenges and DX pain points we're aware of;
  - new ideas, insight and experience brought by Kyle Mathews

- something we've been brewing as a team in private for a few weeks
- initially it was just ideas and an experiment, so we kept the initial exploration private

C:

- we're increasingly convinced it's the way forward
- and our focus on it is affecting our responsiveness and velocity on the current product

- so it's time to explain what we're doing

Q:

- what's going on?
- what's changed?
- what does this mean for you as a developer using Electric?

A:

- what is electric-next
- why have we changed our approach?
- what's the difference?
  - design / nature of the system
  - what you can us it for
  - what makes it special
- where does this leave the current system? should you use it?
- where we are in the implementation of the next system?
- what can you use it for?
- is there a roadmap?
- can you get involved in development?
