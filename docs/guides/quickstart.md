# Quickstart

This guide will get you up and running with `electric-next` and real-time sync of your Postgres data. First using the [HTTP API](/api/http) directly. Then using our [TypeScript client](/api/clients/typescript) with a [React hook](/api/connectors/react) to sync data into a simple application.

## Setup

You need to have a Postgres database with logical replication enabled and then to run Electric in front of it, connected via `DATABASE_URL`.

You can use any Postgres (new or existing) that has logical replication enabled. You also need to connect as a database user that has the [`REPLICATION` privilege](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-security.html).

Electric is an [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) web application published as a Docker image at [electricsql/electric-next](https://hub.docker.com/r/electricsql/electric-next). You can run the Elixir application directly, following the [instructions in the README](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric-next/blob/main/packages/sync-service/README.md). Or you can run using Docker, for example:

```sh
docker run electricsql/electric-next \
    -e DATABASE_URL="..." \
    -p 3000:3000
```

To run a fresh Postgres and Electric already connected together you can use a Docker Compose file like the example in [.support/docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric-next/blob/main/.support/docker-compose.yml):

```sh
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/electric-sql/electric-next/main/.support/docker-compose.yml" -o docker-compose.yml
docker compose up
```

  <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
    â“˜ The rest of this guide assumes you're running Electric against a fresh Postgres database.
  </p>
</div>

## HTTP API

You can now start using Electric's HTTP API!

#### Try running the following curl command

This request asks for a [Shape](/guides/shapes) composed of the entire `foo` table:

```sh
curl -i http://localhost:3000/v1/shape/foo?offset=-1
```

::: info A bit of explanation about the URL structure.

- `/v1/shape/` is a standard prefix with the API version and the shape sync endpoint path
- `foo` is the name of the root table of the shape (and is required); if you wanted to sync data from the `items` table, you would change the path to `/v1/shape/items`
- `offset=-1` means we're asking for the *entire* Shape as we don't have any of the data cached locally yet. If we had previously fetched the shape and wanted to see if there were any updates, we'd set the offset to the last offset we'd already seen.
:::

You should get a response like this:

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
date: Wed, 17 Jul 2024 20:30:31 GMT
content-length: 62
vary: accept-encoding
cache-control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate
x-request-id: F-MaJcF9A--cg9QAAAeF
access-control-allow-origin: *
access-control-expose-headers: *
access-control-allow-methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS
Server: ElectricSQL/0.0.1
content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{"offset":["can't be blank"],"root_table":["table not found"]}%
```

So it didn't work! Which makes sense... as it's an empty database without any tables or data. Let's fix that.

### Create a table and insert some data

Use your favorite Postgres client to connect to Postgres e.g. with [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) you can run:

```sh
psql "postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:54321/electric"
```

Then create a `foo` table

```sql
CREATE TABLE foo (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  value FLOAT
);
```

And insert some rows:

```sql
INSERT INTO foo (name, value) VALUES
  ('Alice', 3.14),
  ('Bob', 2.71),
  ('Charlie', -1.618),
  ('David', 1.414),
  ('Eve', 0);
```

#### Now try the curl command again

```sh
curl -i http://localhost:3000/v1/shape/foo?offset=-1
```

Success! You should see the data you just put into Postgres in the shape response:

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
date: Wed, 17 Jul 2024 20:38:07 GMT
content-length: 643

[{"offset":"0_0","value":{"id":1,"name":"Alice","value":3.14},"key":"\"public\".\"foo\"/1","headers":{"action"
:"insert"}},{"offset":"0_0","value":{"id":2,"name":"Bob","value":2.71},"key":"\"public\".\"foo\"/2","headers":
{"action":"insert"}},{"offset":"0_0","value":{"id":3,"name":"Charlie","value":-1.618},"key":"\"public\".\"foo\

lic\".\"foo\"/4","headers":{"action":"insert"}},{"offset":"0_0","value":{"id":5,"name":"Eve","value":0.0},"key
":"\"public\".\"foo\"/5","headers":{"action":"insert"}},{"headers":{"control":"up-to-date"}}]%
```

::: info What are those messages in the response data?
When you request shape data using the HTTP API you're actually requesting entries from a log of database operations affecting the data in the shape. This is called the **Shape Log**.

The `offset` that you see in the messages and provide as the `?offset=...` query parameter in your request identifies a position in the log. The messages you see in the response are shape log entries (the ones with `value`s and `action` headers) and control messages (the ones with `control` headers).
:::

At this point, you could continue to fetch data using HTTP requests. However, let's switch up to fetch the same shape to use in a React app instead.

## React app

Run the following to create a react application:

```sh
npm create vite@latest my-electric-app -- --template react-ts
```

Install the Electric React package:

```sh
cd my-electric-app
npm install --save @electric-sql/react
```

Wrap your root in `src/main.tsx` with the `ShapesProvider`:

```tsx
import { ShapesProvider } from '@electric-sql/react'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ShapesProvider>
      <App />
    </ShapesProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```

Replace `App.tsx` with the following. Note that we're requesting the same shape as before:

```tsx
import { useShape } from '@electric-sql/react'

function Component() {
  const { data } = useShape({
    baseUrl: `http://localhost:3000`,
    shape: { table: `foo` }
  })

  return JSON.stringify(data, null, 4)
}

export default Component
```

Finally run the dev server to see it all in action!

```sh
npm run dev
```

You should see output like this in the browser:

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Alice",
        "value": 3.14
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Bob",
        "value": 2.71
    },
    {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "Charlie",
        "value": -1.618
    },
    {
        "id": 4,
        "name": "David",
        "value": 1.414
    },
    {
        "id": 5,
        "name": "Eve",
        "value": 0
    }
]
```

#### Postgres as a real-time database

Go back to your Postgres client and update a row. It'll instantly be synced to your component!

```sql
UPDATE foo SET name = 'James' WHERE id = 2;
```

Congratulations! You've now built your first Electric app!
